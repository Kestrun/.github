# .github

This repository defines **organization-wide defaults** for the [Kestrun](https://github.com/kestrun) GitHub org.  
GitHub automatically applies many of these files across all repositories in the organization unless overridden locally.

## 📂 Contents

- **Profile**
  - [`profile/README.md`](./profile/README.md) → The organization profile page (shown at [github.com/kestrun](https://github.com/kestrun)).
- **assets**
  - `kestrun-wordmark-light.svg` → Logo for the Kestrun organization

## 🤔 Why This Repo Exists

GitHub treats `.github` as a **special repo**:

- Files here act as **defaults** across all repos in the org.  
- Individual repos can override them if needed.  
- This ensures consistency in community standards, issue triage, and CI/CD setup.
